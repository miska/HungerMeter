Description: "Simple monitor showing current battery consumption. Visible in cover action as well, so you can peek to see how battery hungry is your phone at it’s current state even from running applications.

It displays three values - current consumption which is by default last 1s, average which is by default average for last 10s and long average which is 24 hours. You can configure these time intervals via Settings menu as well as sampling intervals. Short values are kept only during application runtime, long average value is kept even between application runs. There is an option to store these statistics even to permanent storage to keep them available after reboot.

Hunger meter can help you decide whether changes you did to your device setup are going to help you get better battery life or not (for example which applications doesn’t hurt keep running on background and which does). It also gives you estimate how long will your battery last given your customs and average consumption.

NOTE: Running this application can also increase a consumption a little. It periodically takes measurements to average them and displaying graph can take some more effort as well.S"
