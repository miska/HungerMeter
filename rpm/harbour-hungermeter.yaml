Description: "Simple monitor showing current battery consumption. Visible in cover
  action as well, so you can peek to see how battery hungry is your phone at it\u2019s
  current state even from running applications (that affect consumption).\n\nIt displays
  two values - current consumption which is last 1s and average which is average for
  last 10s. Via pull down/push up menus you can configure different intervals. Settings
  are not saved so they affect application only till it is shut down.\nHunger meter
  is so far really simple - not much more than HelloWorld, but it can be already useful
  to help you decide whether changes you did to your device setup are going to help
  you get better battery life or not (for example which applications doesn\u2019t
  hurt keep running on background and which does)."
